# strmanip

`strmanip`, or the String Manipulation package, is a simple Go package to handle typical and semi-typical string manipulations.

## Tests

There are trivial tests for `Unique`, `Merge`, and `MergeSort`.  This should be sufficient to demonstrate the components work; given how they are used internally it carries that the rest are functional.
